##Wortham-Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session**

  * I was mostly struggling with the branch merging and push to Github processes.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS**

  * All of the concepts! Merging branches and creating pull requests in Github make a lot more since now.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide**

  * We mostly asked the guide about git workflow, like what the difference was between "git pull" and "git fetch".

  * I asked my partner how he did some cool command-line short cuts like "Tab" and the arrow buttons.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

  * Everything about Git seems pretty clear right now, but I have had some trouble on 2.1 merging and pushing to Github.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

  * I was super nervous but am walking away very happy and relieved by the whole experience.
